Hi my name is Nel welcome to my github account 
My hobbies are Playing guitar, basketball and learning new things.
My goal for this year is to become a Web developer and land a job as a Junior web developer.
I want to be a web developer because it is dream profession. Also I really like coding and I want to pursue it to satisfy my curiosity.
